# React Employee Directory

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview:
This app uses React to make a searchable/sortable employee directory.  The app currently is generating a random list of 20 people by calling the random user generator API (https://randomuser.me/) and rendering a functional employee directory with the response given by the API.  This was primarily accomplished with React, functional and class components, and the random user API.

To use the app simply launch the page and you will immedietly see an employee directory.  If you would like to sort the directory alphabetically either by first or last name click on one of the radio buttons at the top of the page.  Also if you would like to search for a particular person in the directory enter either their first or last name in the search box at the top of the page.
